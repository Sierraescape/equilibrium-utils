## Euler Maglev

![maglev logo](docs/maglev.png)

Maglev is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that uses [Euler Vaults](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-vault-kit-white-paper/) as leveraged lending products in order to extend the range of its reserves and thereby improve the capital efficiency of liquidity provisioning.

It implements a conventional Uniswap2-style interface, but internally supports custom pricing curves and other advanced functionality.
