# Euler Maglev

![maglev logo](docs/maglev.png)

Maglev is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that uses [Euler Vaults](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-vault-kit-white-paper/) to *mag*nify capital efficiency using *lev*erage. By borrowing assets as needed, maglev AMMs can extend the range of their reserves and earn fees on trades several times larger than their liquidity outlay.

To swappers, maglev presents a conventional Uniswap2-style interface but internally it supports custom pricing curves and other advanced functionality.

## Concept

Given a fixed size investment, Maglev aims to increase the size of trades that can be serviced relative to a conventional AMM such as Uniswap. It does this by borrowing the "out token" and collateralising this loan with the received "in token". Later on, when somebody wishes to swap in the reverse direction, they repay the loan and receive the excess collateral, unwinding the borrow position.

Because the total size of the position can be many times larger than the initial investment (depending on how much LTV/leverage is allowed on the underlying lending pools), the swap fees earned can be magnified.

The down-side is that while the AMM holds this leveraged position, it is paying interest on the loan. Fortunately, this is partially compensated by the fact that the AMM is simultaneously earning interest on the collateral. In some cases, this interest rate spread can be reduced further by taking advantage of incentives such as points/rewards.

## Operation

Since the level of acceptable borrowing risk is not be the same for every user, pooled deposits are not supported. Each Maglev instance manages funds for a single entity (who of course may be jointly owned).

Maglev is a contract designed to be used as an [EVC operator](https://evc.wtf/docs/whitepaper/#operators). This means that the user, known as the *holder*, does not give up control over their funds to a smart contract, but instead retains it in their wallet. The holder can be any compatible address, including standard multisig wallets or even an EOA.

### Usage

The following are the high-level steps required to use Maglev:

* Deposit funds into one or both of the vaults in proportion of the initial price
* Deploy the desired Maglev contract, choosing parameters such as the vaults, debt limits, and the desired `fee`
* Install the Maglev contract as an operator for your account
* Invoke the `configure()` function on the Maglev contract

At this point, anyone can invoke `swap()` on the Maglev contract, and this will perform borrowing and transferring activity between the two vaults.

### Reconfiguration

All user-configurable parameters are stored in immutable variables, meaning they cannot be changed after the AMM is deployed. Instead, the AMM should be uninstalled as an EVC operator, and a new Maglev instance should be created and installed in its place.

In order to temporarily disable a Maglev instance, `pause()` and `unpause()`

### Fees

### Virtual Reserves

The initial deposits in the vaults represent the initial investment, and are swapped back and forth in response to swapping activity. In a conventional AMM such as Uniswap, these balance are called *reserves*. However, if swapping was constrained to these assets alone, then this would imply a hard limit on the size of swaps that can be serviced. To increase the effective funds, Maglev AMMs are configured with *virtual reserves*. These are typically larger than the size of the conventional reserves, which signifies that not only can all the assets be swapped from one vault to another, but even more assets can be borrowed on the Maglev's account.

Virtual reserves control the maximum debt that the Maglev contract will attempt to acquire on each of its two vaults. Each vault can be configured independently.

For example, if the initial investment has a NAV of $1000, and virtual reserves are configured at $5000 for each vault, then the maximum LTV loan that the AMM will support will be `5000/6000 = 0.8333`. In order to leave a safety buffer, it is recommended to select a maximum LTV that is below the borrowing LTV of the vault.

Note that it depends on the [curve](#curves) if the maximum LTV can actually be achieved. A constant product will only approach these reserve levels asymptotically, since each unit will get more and more expensive. However, with constant sum, this LTV can be achieved directly.

### Desynchronised Virtual Reserves

The Maglev contract tracks what it believes the reserves to be by caching their values in storage. These reserves are updated on each swap. However, since the balance is not actually held by the Maglev contract (it is simply an operator), the actual underlying balances may get out of sync. This can happen gradually as interest is accrued, or suddenly if the holder moves funds or the position is liquidated.

When this occurs, the `syncVirtualReserves()` should be invoked. This determines the actual balances (and debts) of the holder, and adjusts them by the configured virtual reserve levels.



## Curves

### Constant Sum

This "curve" simply adds the values of the two reserves together and ensures that after a swap this sum has not decreased. This curve is mostly suitable for assets that are pegged to the same value, such as stable/stable pairs.

This curve supports a price fraction so that the two tokens can have different relative values, which can be useful if the peg is other than 1:1, or if the tokens have differing decimals.

In this curve, the entire virtual reserves can be consumed, and since each marginal unit of the swap has the same price, there is no direct incentive to deleverage the position. However, for the same reason this does allow fixed fees for swaps of any allowed size (fixed price impact).

### Constant Product

This is the traditional Uniswap2 curve that preserves the product of the two reserves. The larger a swap, the higher the price impact and the more profitable it is to arbitrage a disbalanced pool back to its wider market price.
